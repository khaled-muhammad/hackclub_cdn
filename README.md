## ⚙️ Configuration

- API endpoints are configured in [`src/consts.ts`](src/consts.ts). By default, API requests are proxied to `/api`.
- For authentication and file operations, ensure your backend implements the required endpoints (see [UploadWrapper.README.md](./UploadWrapper.README.md) for details).
- Environment variables can be set in `.env` if needed for custom API URLs.

- **Upload Files**: Drag & drop or use the upload button. Progress and errors are shown in real-time.
- **Organize**: Create folders, move files, and manage your content visually.
- **Share**: Share files/folders with others by email or generate a public link.
- **Star & Trash**: Star important files for quick access, or move items to trash.
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find files by name, type, or tag.
